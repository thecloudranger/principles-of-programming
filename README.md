# Principles of Programming

Understanding programming principles and design patterns is beneficial to any programmer. This summary is for my own reference, but it may be useful to you during design, discussion, or analysis. The list isn't exhaustive, and often compromises must be made between opposing beliefs. Higher-ranking principles, on the other hand, usually outperform lower-ranking principles.

This list was inspired from [The Principles of Good Programming](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=331531).
Suggestions are appreciated through a pull request or through comments [here](https://github.com/thecloudranger/principles-of-programming/issues).
